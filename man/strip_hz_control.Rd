\title{Replace Horizontal Spacing Control Characters}
\usage{
strip_hz_control(txt, stops = 8L, sgr.supported)
}
\arguments{
\item{txt}{character to covert}

\item{stops}{integer, what tab stops to use}

\item{sgr.supported}{logical whether the current display device supports
ANSI CSI SGR.  See [diffPrint]'s `sgr.supported` parameter.}
}
\value{
character, `txt` with horizontal control sequences replaced.
}
\description{
Removes tabs, newlines, and manipulates the text so that
it looks the same as it did with those horizontal control
characters embedded.  Currently carriage returns are also processed, but
in the future they no longer will be.  This function is used when the
\code{convert.hz.white.space} parameter to the
\code{\link[=diffPrint]{diff*}} methods is active.  The term \dQuote{strip}
is a misnomer that remains for legacy reasons and lazyness.
