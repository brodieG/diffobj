Generate a colorized diff of two R objects for an intuitive visualization of their differences.

> See the [introductory vignette for details][1].

## Output

If your terminal supports formatting through ANSI escape sequences, `diffobj` will output colored diffs to the terminal.  Otherwise, output will be colored with HTML/CSS and sent to the IDE viewport or to your browser.  `diffobj` comes with several built-in color schemes that can be further customized.  Some examples:
